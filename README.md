# WILL SUSTAIN

Our products are build with sustainibility in mind.
They are made from recyclable materials that outlast other products, as they are designed tougher and easier to repair.
We take care that you will always get spare part to a fair price.
When you can't make use of our product anymore we take it back and make the most out of it.

## Goals for a product

### User facing

- Easy to acquire
- Easy to repair
- Easy to dispose

### Producer / Servicer facing

- Easy to assemble (also by robots) – e.g. Parts easily align together
- Easy disassemble (also by robots) – e.g. no glue or hidden clips
- Easy to upgrade – Parts and modules are exchangeable - e.g swap mainboard
- requires few tools – e.g. only 2 screwdrivers required
- requires no special tools – e.g. no custom screw driver bit required
- requires few steps to swap one piece – e.g. opening the housing, reveals most parts to swap
- usage of recycled/able materials - e.g. PETG from bottles can be used
- usage of few varying materials – e.g. only use PETG for plastic parts
- usage of sturdy components – e.g. metal instead of plastic gears
- usage of few varying parts – e.g. use of one screw type and length

### No end-of-life

Manufacturer obliges to provide all required data to reproduce the product before going to market.
Any later updates most be transmitted as well.

- Software / Firmware
- Hardware production files (CAD, CAM)
- Electronics production files (PCB)
- Manufacturing tools (Injection molds)

In case the producer can't provide spare parts, we have all required files to reproduce the required part.

## Spare Parts

Replacement parts can have different origins.

- stocked replacement parts (build extra)
- cannibalized parts (taken from old or broken machines)
- parts reproduced with their original injection mold
- parts reproduced with rapid manufacturing method (3D print, CNC, laser cut)

To service a defect device, the most sustainable method should be considered.
Costs of manual labor should be compensated by our system to a level they only play a minor role.
Multiple factors can effect this, depending on locality and availablity.

- nearest stockage
- shipping costs (money, emissions, ...) of part
- shipping costs of required parts to remanufacture
- lead time
- manual labor

In case lead time gets too long, a temporary or permanent replacement must be considered.
